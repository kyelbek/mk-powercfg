# mk-powercfg
Simple frontend for Windows PowerCFG utility.
It provides easy to use user interface and enables access for faster OS power profiles changing without digging into control panel.
You can customize personalized power plans in app and change them easily via Tray bar.

Might be useful for newer, powerful notebooks which might have overheating problems when using older, unoptimized software.
You will be able to cap your processor performance when it's not needed.

Not yet functional, but soon.


Roadmap:
- Make it actually functional (CPU max power cap functionality is on priority list).
- Release stable version.
- Make most useful PowerCFG features configurable from this GUI.
- Per-app profiles with app detection and profiles auto-switching, seamlessly. Quiet fans? Yay!
- (Maybe) Make it possible to save configs in-app and actually use only one power plan in system settings.
